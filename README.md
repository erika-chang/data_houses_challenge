## 🏡 House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
This repository contains my solution to the Kaggle competition House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. The goal of the competition is to predict the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa using various features describing each house.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Accurately predicting house prices is a classic regression problem. Using a rich dataset with 79 explanatory variables, this project aims to build a predictive model for estimating the sale prices of homes using advanced regression techniques.

## 🔍 Key Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data distributions, missing values, and feature importance.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.

Model Selection: Using models such as Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

Model Evaluation: Using cross-validation and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate performance.

Ensembling: Combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.
